# AVSYNTH_crude0
here is a rough version of a transcoding based AV synth.  its designd for midi inputs right now for the most dynamic working with the video
feedback aspects of the synth i almost reccomend not using it at this moment if yr not working with a knobby midi controller mapped to
the video controls bc otherwise u r not going to get much of the full! dynamic experience
