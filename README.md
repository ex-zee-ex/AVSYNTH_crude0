# AVSYNTH_crude0
here is a rough version of a transcoding based AV synth.  its designd for midi inputs right now for the most dynamic working with the video
feedback aspects of the synth i almost reccomend not using it at this moment if yr not working with a knobby midi controller mapped to
the video controls bc otherwise u r not going to get much of the full! dynamic experience


i couldn't get it to upload the everything with the proper filestructure for whatever reason, if you want to run this in like xcode r whatever check out the look.jpg to see what the folders should be organized like
